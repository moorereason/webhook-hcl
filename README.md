# Webhook HCL Playground

This repository contains a proof-of-concept playground for using HCL in
[webhook](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook/).

## Goals

- Use [HCLv2](github.com/hashicorp/hcl) to provide a custom, intuitive config DSL.
- Use functions and variables within the DSL for easy expression evaluation.
- Support all CLI options in the config file.

## Progress

See TODO.md.
